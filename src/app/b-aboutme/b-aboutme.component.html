                    Hi, I am a Frontend developer based in Cologne, Germany. After school, I completed an apprenticeship
                    in
                    IT and gained a total of around 8 years of professional experience. To turn my passion into a
                    profession, I completed the intensive course at the Developer Academy in August 2022.
